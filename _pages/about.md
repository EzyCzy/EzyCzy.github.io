Hello, hello, I'm Amirul Haziq from [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia), my online persona is usually known as EzyCzy.
I'm a huge fan of mathematics and computer science, some call me a nerd, some says that I just have a passion. Hence, I built this website purely for bragging rights (jk, I'm nothing special).

This is Einstien not me (too lazy to change into my picture) -->

Anyway, the purpose of this website is for me to reflect with an online audience (my ego is too big for a private thoughts). Everything written on this website is the truth and the truth of what I feel, think and believe. Though I don't mind people judging me, but do bear with my existential, sceptic and liberal thoughts :D

In addition, I also will be displaying my current projects github (mostly mathematics simulation).

If you are interested in collaborating with me do [email](mailto:mirulh406@gmail.com) me!
