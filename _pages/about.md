Hello, hello, I'm Amirul Haziq from [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia), my online persona is usually known as EzyCzy.
I'm a huge fan of mathematics and computer science, some call me a nerd, some says that I just have a passion. Either way, I built this website purely for bragging rights (jk, I'm nothing special).


Anyway, the purpose of this website is for me to reflect about life with an online audience (mainly to practice my essay writing skills and to push myself to explore non-stem topics). Everything written on this website is the truth and the truth of what I feel, think and believe. Though I don't mind people judging me, but do bear with my existential, sceptic and liberal thoughts :D

In addition, I also will be displaying my current projects github (mostly mathematics stuff).

If you are interested in collaborating with me do [email](mailto:mirulh406@gmail.com) me!
