One of my friend told me that I was a life smart person - someone whom nagivates life with the upmost efficient way -, I had always considered myself as a book smart person, I like to learn from theory and come up with solution using whatever knowledge that I've acquired thus far in my life. Before, I could deny that claim, I thought "maybe he has a point", so today I'm going to attempt to find a conclusive idea on what kind of smart am I.

## Breaking down my thought process
The reason why I initially want to deny his claim is because, I've always centralized my thoughts according to facts, theory and assumptions which I gain from reading and just experiencing life. Therefore, streetsmart or lifesmart is the last category I would label myself. However, I'll try to make this claim a true as possible given my context. 

In order to do this, I need to understand how my thought process works, I'd simply put it in an algorithmic manner (Let say I have an input of new information):
<ul>
1) I look the input in memory, If I find it, I stop. <br>
2) If not, then I'll try to extract the closest memory that can possibly resembles the input. <br>
3) then, I try to create a reasoning how this old memory relates to the input. <br>
4) If it is relatively false, I repeat back to step 2. <br>
5) If it is true, I stop.
</ul>
The above is how I believe my train of thought operates. Though it may be wrong, let's move further from here. Next, we need to recognize, what makes a person lifesmart. According to <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/street-smart#:~:text=%2F%CB%88stri%CB%90t%20sm%C9%91%CB%90rt%2F,smartTopics%20Personal%20qualitiesc2">this</a><a href="#oxfordonline"><sup>1</sup></a>, street-smart person is defined as a human ​having the knowledge and experience that is needed to deal with the difficulties and dangers of life in a big city, while <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/book-smart">book-smart</a> person is a human having a lot of academic knowledge learned from books and studying, but not necessarily knowing much about people and living in the real world. So, which category do I fit the most?

People that know me in real life would vouch me as a book-smart person because I usually spend most of my time learning new things online, this varies to education, health, video games, academics... etc. But according the definition, I might aswell be fit as a street-smart person because I navigate myself through personal and external experiences. We're in a grey spot here.
Before deciding which labels I fit into, how about we delve to some theory of different types of intelligent (in an attempt to understand how professional categorises our thinking style).

## Recognizing a few phenotype of smartness
I could've chosen a more recent source but for the purpose of this post it might just do it. According to a Harvard psychologist and professor, Howard Gardner, in his book "Frames of Mind" dated on 1983 states there are 8 different type of intelligents. Im too lazy to write down each of them so I'll be crediting a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html">CNBC article</a>. <br>

In summary on a scale of 1 to 5:

<ul>
1) Spatial intelligence:
The ability to think abstractly and in multiple dimensions. Scoring a five means you have a large capacity for spatial reasoning and conceptualization.<br> <br>
2) Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence:
The ability to use your body in a way that demonstrates physical and athletic prowess.  <br><br>
3) Musical intelligence: Sensitivity to rhythm, pitch, meter, tone, melody and timbre. This may entail the ability to sing and/or play musical instruments <br><br>
4) Linguistic intelligence: Sometimes called “language intelligence,” this involves sensitivity to the meaning of words, the order among words, and the sound, rhythms, inflections and meter of words. <br><br>
5) Logical-mathematical intelligence: The ability to analyze problems logically, carry out mathematical operations and investigate issues scientifically <br><br>
6) Interpersonal intelligence: The ability to interact effectively with others. Sensitivity to others people’s moods, feelings, temperaments and motivations. <br><br>
7) Intrapersonal intelligence: Sensitivity to one’s own feelings, goals and anxieties, and the capacity to plan and act in light of one’s own traits. <br><br>
8) Naturalistic intelligence: The ability to understand the nuances in nature, including the distinction between plants, animals, and other elements of nature and life <br><br>
</ul>

Therefore, in this theory of intelligence, one's intellect isn't black and white. However, a person may posses one or more dominance on these traits. To fit in my argument, the category (street/book-smart) that I fit in must be one of my dominant intelligence area. 
## Reaching a conclusion
We've gone so far yet reached so little. Thus, it begs the question, What am I? (wait, lets not go there...) okay okay, so am I street or book smart? From all eight smartness, I guess spatial, logical and intrapersonal intelligence are my strengths. <i>Of course, I do have some capacity for other types of intelligence >:( </i>. I'm far from a streetsmart person, despite having plans for future, a lot of logic is going on BTS<a href="#bts"><sup>2</sup></a>, backup plans among backup plans, and a lot of reading to understand different perspectives. It does not come naturally to me that I'm able understand the world on my own without referencing to others. Although, being a booksmart person gives a negative connotation, that way of comprehending us is a bit naive. Everyone is intelligent on their own ways, as long as all of us are contributing member of society, I believe it doesn't hurt to be a lil bit different :)
